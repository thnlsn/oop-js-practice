Constructor Inheritance
ES6 Class Inheritance
Object.create() Inheritance
'this' in a function call and why that is problematic in class inheritance
Why is the new operator special
When to link prototypes?
How do functions, arrays, and objects have access to their methods?
Difference between .__proto__ and prototype?
  - .__proto__ is the prototype of whatever object the object with it is linked to (parent), via the prototype chain.
  - prototype is what will be the .__proto__ of the object linked to it (children).
What is the difference between things put inside the constructor vs inside the prototype?
  - Things in the constructor will be available on the instance directly, while things in the prototype will be available in the .__proto__ property of an instance.
super()
constructor()
extends
How can you chain methods in classes/constructors?
  - Make sure chainable methods return 'this' which is the object itself.

Class Fields/Methods
  - Public fields
  - Private fields
  - Public methods
  - Private methods

What are Class fields?
  - Public fields are properties that are on every single instance of a class, meaning they are default, and not even passed in.
    - They are in the instances rather than the prototype
